# Analyzing a sales report from Amazon.com with Python

For this data analysis I chose to use dict as a form of categorizing the key with the value I needed for each question.

Dictionaries created:

|Dict name|key:value|
|---|---|
|Sales by month|month: sales|
|Revenue by month|month: revenue|
|Sales by city|city: sales|
|Sales per hour|occurrence of hour: hour|
|Sales by product|product name: quantity ordered|


With this excercise we were able to tell the following:
1) The month with the most sales was **December** with 28114 products sold 
2) In December the **total revenue** was **USD 4,613,443.34**
3) The sales in December represent a **13.45% from total sales**
4) **Los Angeles** reported the most amount of sales
5) The sales from **Los Angeles** represent a **48.87%** del total
6) The most sold product is the **27in FHD Monitor**
